# Fixed stars brighter than Magnitude 5 
# This file is based on data provided by S. Moshier.
# 7 Mai 1999:
# File was improved by Valentin Abramov, Tartu, Estonia.
# - The stars are ordered by constellation.
# - Most names come from Arabic and have several transliterations, 
#   e.g. Algieba and Al Jabhah. In such cases, the record has been duplicated 
#   and both spellings have been given.
# The Galactic Center is taken from a star map of the Galactic Center region in
# "Sterne und Weltraum", Nov. 1991, p. 641. 
# The data are:
# traditional name (no leading blanks in field)
# nomenclature name (no leading blanks in field)
# equinox (must be either 1950 or 2000)
# rectascension hours
#               minutes
#               seconds
# declination   degrees
#               minutes
#               seconds
# proper motion in rectasc., time seconds per century 
#               in decl., arc seconds per century
